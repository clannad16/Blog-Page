          <h2>How FARMEASY can help you</h2>
          <p>The one thing that is common in all startups, and their founders, is a love for speed.
            And Scale. We at Ninjacart want to solve fast, build fast, and deploy fast.
            It took us 6 years of solving, building, and deploying to come up with a
            Tech Stack that is ready to serve 60k+ farmers and 100k+ retail customers across
            the length and breadth of India.

            What if you could get access to our Platform?
            What if we tell you we’ll take care of the technology,
            and you’ll be ready to hit the ground running in your country in less than a month!</p>

          <h2>Putting the Human in Human Resources</h2>
          <p>As most organizations have initiated RTO (Return to Office)
            rules and hybrid working, it got me thinking about how HR policies
            support and influence the culture of an organization.
            After all – culture is often defined as the assimilation of shared beliefs and values
            in an organization, which ultimately make the “aura of a place”.
            In knowledge-based organizations, culture is ever-evolving as each
            new person who logs in, brings with them a distinct, unique flavour which
            adds to the organization’s way of working.

            HR policies. Guidelines. Standards. Call it what you may, this set of instructions
            often gives vocabulary to an organization’s culture.
            HR policies convey, in a more tangible manner, the organization’s stance and expectations. </p>

          <h2>Encouraging international partnerships to solve the biggest problems
            in the agri-ecosystem, together</h2>
          <p>The idea of articulating thoughts and solving problems is an approach to
            drive success and make a difference at higher levels.
            At FarmEasy, we have been receiving requests and queries for
            collaborations from various organizations working in the Agri-supply chain domain.
            Assessing the opportunity to make a large impact globally, FarmEasy has
            opened up for strategic collaboration with start-ups/organizations around
            the world and helped them catalyze their growth by leveraging Ninjacart’s
